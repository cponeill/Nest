Nest
====

The following code is an exercise in organic motion. I would be lying if i  said that I had a plan for this to come together because I did not. I am still learning how to use this programming language. I call this program Nest because once the software is running, it looks as though it is building a nest. I think  this would actually be pretty cool in a bigger space and on a larger screen. If there is a use for it I will find it. But it is definitely pretty cool to  watch since it is difference everytime. Enjoy!
